## What do I mean by efficiency in terms of writing code?
It is of the utmost important thing to understand what I mean by the term "efficiency" when considering today's or future developer's world. It includes several characteristics, but let's focus on a majority of them:
* Writing code much faster
* Writing clean cone
* Writing high-quality code
* Writing code while following the best practices, etc.

We already know that these points are really important when writing production-level code, and at the time of hiring company prioritizes the candidate who acquires these capabilities. 
According to the 20th edition of the State of the Developer Nation report, there were 26.8 million active software developers in the world at the end of 2021. And experts predicted that the number of developers will grow to reach 45 million by 2030. Looking at these massive numbers, I want you to think **"How many of them code really in an efficient manner?"**, unfortunately, the answer is heart-melting.

## How can we increase our efficiency when writing code?
As of now, I'm pretty sure that you must have understood what I'm willing to say by the term **"increasing our efficiency"**. So let's get back to the current section i.e, " How can we increase our efficiency when writing code?". To improve our efficiency there are many things that we've to keep in our mind,
* It comes with practice and experience
* You have to learn alternative ways to solve one specific problem
* You have to think before you start writing code, etc

I know these processes are tedious and will take time, but trust me there is nothing to worry about. Because this article is having a piece of good news for all the readers. So without further ado, let's open the gift and see what is there inside for you all.
